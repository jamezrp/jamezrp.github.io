<p>It's 4am and I'm not sleeping for some reason...my internal clock is probably off a decade. So I'm investigating whether using Github's built-in editor for a website creation tool is sufficient. I'm already certain it isn't.</p>

<p>And faster than spinning up another wordpress instance. Seriously, WP sucks. I really hate it. </p>

<p>Because systems are meant to work in tandem with each other, and they're supposed to by cyclical. If they aren't, then pieces stick out, things get slow, and suddenly you've got a ton of code that doesn't matter except for that one obscure thing that is probably deprecated but there's at least one person still using it. That asshat. </p>

<p>It was going to be an image but apparently you don't upload images, you just provide links and Github reads and displays them. Which is probably smarter for them, but not particularly great for this.</p>
